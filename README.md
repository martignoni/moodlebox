A project to build a Moodle server and Wi-Fi router on Raspberry Pi.

## The MoodleBox Documentation

Visit the [MoodleBox web site][website] for more information about the MoodleBox features or any question about the usage of a MoodleBox.

If you just want to use a MoodleBox, a [prepared disk image][download] of the latest released version is [available for downloading][download] and using out of the box on your Raspberry Pi 3A, 3B, 3B+ or 4B. Follow the instructions on the [MoodleBox web site][website].

### Asking Support Questions

We have an active [discussion forum][forum] where users and developers can ask questions. Please don't use the GitHub issue tracker to ask questions.

## Building the MoodleBox disk image from scratch

> If you just want to use a MoodleBox, __you don't need__ to build the MoodleBox disk image yourself. Just [download the MoodleBox image][download] and follow the instructions on the [MoodleBox web site][website].

To build a MoodleBox from scratch with this script, you need a Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4B.

1. Clone [Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit) Lite image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspberry-pi-os/) on your microSD card.
1. Create a `ssh.txt` file on the `boot` partition, e.g. using `touch ssh.txt`.
1. Insert the microSD card into your Raspberry Pi.
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi to your Ethernet network and boot it.
1. [Install Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html) on your computer. On macOS, use e.g. `brew install ansible`.
1. [Install `sshpass`](https://gist.github.com/arunoda/7790979) to enable passing SSH password to the Raspberry Pi. On macOS, use e.g. `brew tap esolitos/ipa; brew install sshpass`.
1. [Clone this repository][git] to your local drive.
1. Create a `keys` directory in the repository folder and copy your public key into it, under the name `id_rsa.pub`.
1. Get the IP address of your Raspberry Pi and change it in the `hosts.yml` file. Do not change anything else, unless you know what you're doing. You're on your own.
1. Run `ansible-playbook moodlebox.yml` from the repository folder.
1. Wait 15–50 minutes, depending on your Raspberry Pi model, SD card speed and Internet bandwidth. You're done.

### Overriding defaults

You can override any of the defaults configured in `default.config.yml` by creating a `config.yml` file and setting the overrides in that file. For example, you can change the MoodleBox main credentials and the timezone with something like:

    moodlebox_username: 'myusername'
    moodlebox_password: 'secret'
    moodlebox_timezone: 'Australia/Perth'

Any variable can be overridden in `config.yml`; see the file `default.config.yml` for a list of available variables.

## Availability

The code is available at [https://github.com/moodlebox/moodlebox][git].
